In recent years, the impact of traffic on both the environment and society has become a growing concern, especially in regions like the canton of Ticino, Switzerland. As often pointed out by media, traffic congestion is a big issue, which tends to worsen around bank holidays or due to roadworks on already challenged routes. Another crucial aspect to consider is the commuter traffic, caused by border area workers flocking back and forth on a daily basis. As a key figure, in 2023 the city of Lugano was listed among the 100 busiest cities of the world in terms of road traffic. It is not even the first one in Switzerland, yet, with an average of 19 minutes and 20 seconds needed to cover a 10 km distance, the figure is still representative of the matter.

This project aims to address this issue by developing a data-driven tool that analyzes the relationship between traffic patterns and some environmental indicators. By combining data collection, analysis, and predictive modeling, our goal is to create a practical and accessible system able to support further research and policy-making.

Our central research question is: how does traffic impact the environment and society in Ticino? To answer this, we implement a Python-based pipeline that collects and processes traffic and pollution data from official and reliable sources, such as OASI (Osservatorio Ambientale della Svizzera Italiana), an organization of the Canton of Ticino that deals with the protection of air, water and soil.
The project also incorporates predictive modeling techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, to explore future trends and scenarios. Results are presented through a web interface and summaries generated with a local large language model (LLM). 

The project showcases how a combination of modern programming tools and statistical techniques can help address real-world problems in a meaningful and scalable way.
