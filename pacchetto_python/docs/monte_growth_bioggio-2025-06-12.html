    This Monte Carlo simulation, based on 10,000 simulations and displaying the results within a 5-95% confidence interval, projects an upward trajectory for NO2 concentrations in Bioggio, Switzerland from 2020 to 2067. The mean estimated concentration is depicted in blue, with the shaded light blue area representing the confidence interval. This trend aligns with the simulation&#x27;s inclusion of exponential traffic growth in the region, suggesting a consistent relationship between increasing traffic and elevated NO2 levels.<br>
