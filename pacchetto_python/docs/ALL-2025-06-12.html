    The dataset shows fluctuations in air pollutants (NO₂, PM10, O₃) and traffic volume over time. Traffic volumes generally exhibit a seasonal pattern with peaks during spring and summer months and lower levels during winter months. Traffic on both highways and main roads tends to be higher in the latter half of the year compared to the first half.  
    There&#x27;s no clear consistent correlation between traffic volume and air pollutant concentrations across all pollutants. For example, while NO₂ shows some fluctuations that align with traffic peaks, PM10 levels don&#x27;t always follow a similar pattern. O₃ exhibits its own distinct trends, often peaking in warmer months regardless of traffic patterns. 
    Further analysis would be needed to determine if specific weather conditions or other factors influence the relationship between traffic and air pollution in Ticino.<br>
