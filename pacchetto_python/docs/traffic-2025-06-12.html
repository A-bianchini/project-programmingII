    The traffic data shows that there is a clear seasonal pattern in Ticino&#x27;s traffic volume. Traffic levels are generally lower during the winter months (December to February) and peak during the summer months (June to August).  There appears to be a gradual increase in traffic from January through April, followed by a more significant surge starting in May and continuing through July. <br>
    Traffic on both highways and main roads follows this general trend, although there are some variations. Highways tend to experience higher traffic volumes overall compared to main roads.<br>
    The data also suggests that weekends or holidays might contribute to increased traffic volume as the numbers fluctuate around these periods.
