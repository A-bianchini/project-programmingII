    The data shows a general downward trend in NO2 levels from 2020 to 2025. This suggests that measures taken to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions are having a positive impact on air quality in Ticino.  NO2 concentrations tend to be higher during the winter months (November-February) and lower during the summer months (June-August). This pattern is likely due to factors such as reduced sunlight, increased use of heating systems, and changes in traffic patterns. <br>

The graph also shows that NO2 levels often exceed the maximum values allowed by both Swiss law and WHO guidelines. While the situation is improving, there&#x27;s still some distance to be covered before air quality reaches recommended standards.<br>
